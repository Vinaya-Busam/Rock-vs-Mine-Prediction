# ROCK vs MINE Prediction
This Project Predicts whether an object detected by sonar is a **Rock** or **Mine** using Machine Learning algorithm **Logistic Regression**.
The model classifies sonal signal data into one of two categories:

- **Rock (R)** -> A natural underwater rock formation
- **Mine (M)** -> A Potential explosive mine

## Dataset
The dataset consists of sonal signals bounced off objects in water. It contains **60 features**

The **Target variable** has two categories:

- **R** -> Rock
- **M** -> Mine

### Language Used:
 - Python
### Libraries Used:
 - pandas (Data Processing)
  
 - numpy (numerical operations)
  
 - matplotlib & seaborn (visualisation)
  
 - scikit-learn (Machine Learning Model)
